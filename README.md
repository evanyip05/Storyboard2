# Storyboard2
version 2 of seanyweany/storyboard, metadata editor for a wip game (displays a level info file using a tileset file, provides an interface to edit and view it)

#TODO
- seperate animation "channels" into movement and cutscene
- reimplement gui features, such as selectors and info display
